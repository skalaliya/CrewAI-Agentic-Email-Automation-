    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download and prepare** the Kaggle spam email classification dataset\n",
    "2. **Train a machine learning model** for baseline spam detection\n",
    "3. **Set up CrewAI agents** for intelligent email processing\n",
    "4. **Compare ML predictions** with AI agent analysis\n",
    "5. **Use advanced features** like information extraction and response drafting\n",
    "6. **Run the complete pipeline** for end-to-end email automation\n",
    "\n",
    "The system combines the speed and accuracy of traditional ML models with the intelligence and context-awareness of AI agents, providing a powerful solution for email automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps:\n",
    "- Configure your OpenAI API key for full functionality\n",
    "- Experiment with different email types and scenarios\n",
    "- Customize agent roles and behaviors in the config files\n",
    "- Deploy the API server for production use\n",
    "- Integrate with email clients or automation systems"
